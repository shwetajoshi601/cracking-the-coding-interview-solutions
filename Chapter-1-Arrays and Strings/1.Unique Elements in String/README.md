# Problem Statement

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if you cannot use additional data structures?

## Points to Remember
1. Whenever you encounter a problem that is related to unique elements in a string or an array, there is a high probability that it can be solved with a Hash Table data structure.
2. The ASCII character set contains 128 characters. (256 in case of the extended character set)
Following ASCII values can be helpful while solving problems:
    * Space - 32
    * 0 -     91
    * a -     97
    * A -     65
